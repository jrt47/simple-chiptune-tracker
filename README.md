# A simple chiptune tracker

## Jonah Townsend


This application will allow users to make music using simple waveforms in an authentic tracker format, without the
additional complexities of professional music tracker software. The application is intended for anyone who wants to
make old-style chiptune music but has little experience using music trackers.

Users will be able to program up to five instrument channels, including:
- Two pulse waves of variable duty cycle
- A sawtooth wave
- A triangle wave
- A noise generator

After building a track, users will have the option for the application to play it back to them at a tempo of their
choice.

As someone who is interested in music as a hobby, this project is very compelling. I have been interested in using
old-style chiptune sounds in the past, but the technical complexity of modern-day tracking software has always been a
barrier. I am excited to start using the application when it is finished.
